first loop through every department to get link to each items
then get description/ingridents blah blah blah without selecting stores

to get price for each stores as well as check if item avaiable in each store,
first go to loblaws get store locations,
then use the SAME driver instance with links to item
if the item is not available in that store, it will be redirected to the main page. see test.py for example
